# WSProgressBar

This is a library for automating the default progress bar created by Innovyze ICM.

Normally, when running a ruby script in the GUI, a Progress bar appears. However this progress bar is static and doesn't appear to progress as a regular progress bar would. I assume that animating this progress bar is on Innovyze's todo list, however in the mean time, I figured this library would be useful for anyone wanting to automate/animate this progressbar.

## Why should I use a progress bar?

Progress bars are a good visual representation of how much time your algorithm will take to finish. This is very important when it comes to usability of your applications.
