# Innovyze-InfoWorks-API-Libraries

Documentation and Libraries for InfoWorks ICM and InfoWorks CS

## Author notes

After experiencing frustration with finding documentation created by Innovyze for InfoWorks ICM and CS, as well as frustrations regarding the updating of those APIs for others (and my own future reference), I created this repository on GitHub where developers can congregate and work on the API documentation together.

Feel free to make push requests, or flag up issues regarding documentation changes and/or APIs which should be added to the repository. I'm always up for worthwhile contributions for the greater good.
