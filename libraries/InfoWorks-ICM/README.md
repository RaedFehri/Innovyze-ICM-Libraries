# Innovyze-ICM-Libraries

## Ruby

A number of open source libraries I've created for ruby developers who are developing custom software for Innovyze's ICM

|    Library     | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Documenation   | ICM ruby documentation re-written in markdown. The idea here is to allow us to update the documentation and fix mistakes in an open source and free way. It also allows us to give advice and tips which can only be learned with experience. |
| WSProgressBar  | Allows developers to control the progress bar while their ruby script is executing. |
| WSLocalStorage | Allows data transfer between scripts run in the same instance of ICM. |
| WSDBFlags      | Get descriptions and colors of flags. |
| WSGem          | (Work in progress) Gem intergration for ICM. |
| Randoms        | A series of tips and tricks for use in Ruby in ICM. |

## AHK

A series of external libraries built for automating ICM. These libraries are going to be less stable than ruby scripting. However they also expose far more functionality. The external libraries also includes an ICM ruby script injector which you can use to inject rubyscript to do the things which ruby is best at doing.
